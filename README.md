# Problem Statement

## Virus Outbreak (100 Marks)

In the Martian land faraway, a new virus has evolved and is attacking the individuals at a fast pace. The scientists have figured out the virus composition, V. The big task is to identify the people who are infected. The sample of N people is taken to check if they are POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. A report is generated which provides the current blood composition B of the person. 


## POSITIVE or NEGATIVE ?

If the blood composition of the person is a subsequence of the virus composition V, then the person is identified as POSITIVE otherwise NEGATIVE.


## Example:

Virus Composition, V = coronavirus<br>
Blood Composition of the person , B = ravus<br>
The person in question is POSITIVE as B is the subsequence of the V. 
<br>
<br>
The scientists are busy with their research for medicine and request you to build a program which can quickly figure out if the person is POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. They will provide you with the virus composition V and all the peopleâ€™s current blood composition. Can you help them?


**Note: The virus and blood compositions are lowercase alphabet strings.**

## Input Format<br>
The first line of the input consists of the virus composition, V <br>
The second line of he input consists of the number of people, N<br>
Next N lines each consist of the blood composition of the ith person, Bi

## Constraints <br>
1<= N <=10 <br>
1<= |B|<= |V|<= 10^5<br><br>



## Output Format<br>
For each person, print POSITIVE or NEGATIVE in a separate line <br>
